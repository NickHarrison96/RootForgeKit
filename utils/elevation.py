# NicksFix — Elevation Helpers
#
# NicksFix deliberately launches UNELEVATED. Only a handful of operations
# actually need Administrator (the iOS tunnel interface, SFC, DISM, and
# machine-scope winget installs) — forcing a UAC prompt on every single
# launch to cover those was pure friction for the ~90% of sessions that
# never touch them.
#
# So elevation is requested at the moment it is needed:
#   * the iOS tunnel elevates just the tunneld process
#     (utils/ios_core/tunnel_manager.py — unchanged, it already did this)
#   * admin-only shell tools offer to relaunch the app elevated, via
#     components/terminal_widget.py's requires_admin path
# =============================================================================
